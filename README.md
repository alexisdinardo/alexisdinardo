## Hi, I'm Alexis DiNardo 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a Master's in Computer Science student at USC, where I combine my curiosity, creativity, and love for learning to explore the constantly growing field of technology.

### 🎬 From Animated Films to AI, 3D Graphics, and Mobile

My passion for animated films as a kid sparked a journey into Computer Graphics. Today, I’m especially fascinated by the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and 3D Animation—how emerging algorithms can bring digital worlds and characters to life in new, expressive ways.

In addition to my academic focus, I’ve gained hands-on experience in mobile and iOS development through multiple internships. Building robust, user-friendly apps has taught me how to translate complex graphical ideas into polished, interactive experiences on devices people use every day. This practical work has deepened my appreciation for the power of graphics and intuitive design, and inspired me to explore how cutting-edge graphics and AI techniques can enhance mobile applications and user interfaces.

### 👩‍💻 What I’m Working On

- Research and projects at the crossroads of AI, graphics, and animation
- Mobile/iOS app development, bringing advanced visuals and seamless interactivity to life
- Constantly learning new frameworks, tools, and techniques in the graphics, AI, and mobile spaces

### 🌱 What Drives Me

- Curiosity about how things work under the hood
- Enjoyment in creative problem solving and making complex ideas accessible
- A belief in lifelong learning—there’s always a new technology or concept to explore
